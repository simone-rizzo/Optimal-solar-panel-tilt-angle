## How it works
The application, through API given by PVGIS, guides the user to the reading of the big amount of data gives by the online software calculator focusing on optimal inclination and optimal orientation. These two values described perfectly the positioning of the user solar and PV panel. In addition, the app shows the user daily mean data of irradiance and power through smart graphs refering to 2013. All these data can be used even for scientific and engineering analysis and can be obtained very quiclky through the simple and the optimized app design.
Features:
-	Clear tutorial that explain app structure
-	Calculation of optimal inclination for the entire year
-	Calculation of optimal orientation for the entire year
-	Calculation of Daily mean power developed by crystSI PV technology
-	Calculation of Daily mean power developed by CdTe PV technology
-	Calculation of Daily mean power developed by CIS PV technology
-	Calculation of Daily mean Irradiance on a well oriented panel
-	Interactive Daily mean power chart
-	Interactive Daily mean irradiance chart
-	Detailed explaination of the physic model & calculations used by PVGIS to calculate app parameters
